Description: svaRetro contains functions for detecting retrotransposed 
    transcripts (RTs) from structural variant calls. It takes structural variant
    calls in GRanges of breakend notation and identifies RTs by exon-exon 
    junctions and insertion sites. The candidate RTs are reported by events and 
    annotated with information of the inserted transcripts.
